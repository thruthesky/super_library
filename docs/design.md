## Design Customization

### UI Design and Customization

The default UI design is built into the custom code, but you can override it.

### Updating the Default UI Design

You can update the default UI design in the Super Library by updating the Theme of your FlutterFlow project. The Super Library follows the FlutterFlow Theme system.

### Using Default Components

The Super Library provides default components. You can either use these default components or copy and paste them to create your own custom components.
