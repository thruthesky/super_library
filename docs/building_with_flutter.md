# Flutter App Development

- This page will teach you how to use the Super library with Flutter to build apps. If you are only interested in building apps with FlutterFlow, this page is not for you.

- The Super Library is a powerful package built for FlutterFlow, offering user management, chat, and forum features. While designed for FlutterFlow, it's also compatible with Flutter projects. This guide will help you integrate it into your Flutter application.

- Note that the Super Library has minimal data modeling to better support JSON-type data in FlutterFlow. Therefore, it's a good idea to build your own data models in your code.

- Refer [Developer Tip](./developer_tip.md) for more information


## Installation

- Configure your Flutter project with a Firebase project
- Install `super_library` as dependency

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     super_library: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
   ```

- If you see too many problems in the `Problems Tab` in VSCode, you may hide it with `dart.analysisExcludedFolders` settings.
